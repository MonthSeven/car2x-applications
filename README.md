# Vehicular applications

~ Public Safety Emergency Application is available (compatible with Veins 4.5).
This application is deeply explained in a Term paper written by [@laurodelacerda](https://github.com/laurodelacerda) and
[@arthurazs](https://github.com/arthurazs). You can check the paper in brazilian portuguese on [arthurazs/la-tcc](https://github.com/arthurazs/la-tcc/blob/master/LA_TCC_V1.pdf) or download it at https://goo.gl/C15sZf. 
For a brief explanation, a short article was published and it can be downloaded at https://goo.gl/zw2eWp (brazilian portuguese).

~ New applications for vehicular environments coming soon.
